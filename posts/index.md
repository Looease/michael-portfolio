The BCS Level 4 software engineer apprenticeship trains students to build and test simple code and take responsibility for the other elements of projects.

The apprenticeship is a great practical introduction to technical careers working in web development. It is an amazing free opportunity to get the training needed to become employable as a software engineer.

Overall, my experience has been great. The level of knowledge I have gained is exponential and my code has dramatically improved in a short space of time. 

We started with a 12 week coding bootcamp focussing on C# and JavaScript. Most apprentices start with little to no knowledge meaning the learning curve is very steep. This however, is an ongoing challenge for any software engineer. As an apprenticeship, you are a full time student and worker. My week is split into 80% full time work for my employer and 20% completing apprentice work. Once a month, we spend a whole day in training learning course content on topics like algorithms, denormalisation and methodologies.

As most of the work is independent, it's important to know what to expect. I've put together a list of resources on my experience with the BCS Level 4 software engineer apprenticeship:
