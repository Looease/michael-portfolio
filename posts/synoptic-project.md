The Synoptic Project brings together the skills and knowledge you've developed throughout your apprenticeship, giving you the opportunity to showcase your abilities.

It was definitely the most challenging part of the apprenticeship for me, particularly from a time perspective. You have 40 hours to complete the project which goes very quick when building a full end to end application. 

## My top tips for tackling the synoptic are: 

- Practice if you can. Assuming you have carried out varied work to check off as many items as possible on the requirements checklist, it is unlikely you will be completely specialist in one area. 
Get practice with:
- `node`
- `postgres`/`sql`
- Dynamic URLs 
- Authentication/Authorisation
- Querying local databases
- Connecting to local databases
- Manual testing
