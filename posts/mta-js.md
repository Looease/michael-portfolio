As part of the BCS Level 4 Software Development Apprenticeship, I needed to complete the MTA (Microsoft Technical Associate) introduction to JavaScript exam. From 2022, this exam will no longer be required for the appreticeship accreditation as Microsoft have stopped supporting it. 

The exam was focussed on the fundamentals of JavaScript with specific attention on:

-  Operators
-  Methods 
-  Keywords
-  Variables
-  Data Types
-  Functions
-  Decisions, Conditions and Loops
-  Interacting with the DOM
-  Interacting with HTML Forms 

The most helpful resource were free mock exams online. There is absolutely no guarantee you'll get similar questions in the exam (I definitely didn't) but they are similar in style. In addition, one of the most challenging parts of the exam was that it was timed and the practice exams give you a chance to prepare to work at the appropriate speed. Below is a practice exam:

To solidify my learning, I wrote out and executed a number of the questions from the practice exam as real code. This turned out to be the most useful revision of all. I created a repository on Git and pushed my revision there:

I used other online practice exams, like the Udemy one below, but they were not as relevant as the previous example.
