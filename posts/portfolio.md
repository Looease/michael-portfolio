The BCS Level 4 Software Engineering Apprentice Portfolio is the largest piece of work required for the course. It is an amalgamation of all of the work you have completed and demonstrates the skills you have gained.

There is set checklist of competencies that you are expected to complete as part of the portfolio. I really appreciated that this checklist pushed me to take on work that I otherwise may not have if I had joined as a junior engineer. It was great to not be pigeon holed to either the frontend or backend and instead to work across the full stack. I started the apprenticeship convinced that I wanted be a front end engineer but the experience I gained in the backend has given me some food for thought on this.

The most important thing to do when preparing to write your portfolio is take screenshots. Start screenshotting the moment you start working whether it's setting up Github or basic coding. The speed that you learn at will be so fast that you will undoubtedly forget what you did a month ago (and maybe even what you did a week ago).

My portfolio was made up of 4 large projects across 70 pages of work. This included a contents page, introduction, the projects, extra-curricular information and a conclusion. 

I found that the best way to cover all parts of the criteria was to add clear subtitles introducing what I would be discussinng next. For example I would introduce the project then have a subtitile called "User Interface" and discuss the front end code. Then I would add a subtitle called "Data & the Backend" and describe my backend work.
