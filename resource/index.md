Learning to code is the best decision I have ever made. Software Engineering is a whole world in itself with endless opportunities to learn and create. The work in business is interesting and diverse. It is rare that you will do the same thing every day. 

Becoming a software engineer is not as difficult as it seems. This section covers how I got started in software engineering and went on to find a job at an amazing company.
