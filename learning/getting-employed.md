Getting a job in Software Engineering can seem daunting. You may be surprised at how many options there are and if you follow some of the tips in this blog, you will be a real life Software Engineer in no time. 

Top tips: 

## Look for apprenticeships
I cannot emphasise enough how awesome apprenticeships are. Yes you won't get paid loads initially and you will be a full time student and worker, but it's completely worth it for the free training you receive. More and more companies are offering apprenticeships. Smart businesses know it's hard and expensive to recruit software engineers and training them in house may solve future reruitment issues. 

The majority of companies in the UK will be paying into the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pay-apprenticeship-levy">Apprenticeship Levy</a> which they will see reduced it they run their own apprenticeship schemes. What's the harm in raising this with your employer? 

## Capitalise on your existing skills
I approached a number of Start Up companies on <a href="https://angel.co/">Angel List</a> because I knew from previous experience that there are often less barriers to entry in start ups. This is because there are tends to be more jobs than people so everyones does a bit of everything.

My previous career was in sales and I found that when I was interviewing, I was getting a lot of job offers to take on a 50/50 role - where 50% of my week would be selling for the company and 50% would be working with the development team to learn to code. If you think you've got the stuff, this could be a unique opportunity to shape a role that is about learning new skills and capitalising on your old ones. 

In addition I met ex teachers who got engineering jobs working on teaching tech and ex pharmacists who are now working in medical tech. It is really useful to have a practical understanding of how the software you buid will be used and this is not something you can teach.

## Look for businesses that value diversity
In a 2011 a study exhibeted that a wider range of educational and work backgrounds produced more-innovative products. The best companies are realising this more and more, with businesses like Google actively leaving positions open till they have created socially diverse teams. This is because diverse teams build products that are more far reaching commercially.  

Look for companies that practice this mantra. You will find all you need to know in 'About us' and 'Company Culture' webpages. 

Check out the foundations like <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/who-we-are/women-in-technology/tech-she-can-charter.html">Tech She Can Charter</a> who are a list of organisations who are actively looking to recruit and promote female tech talent. 

## Send messages directly to recruiters on Linkedin
Unfortunately for job seekers, large companies receive thousands of job applications every day. It is highly likely that yours may get lost in the noise if you only apply through the portals available. Track down and message internal recruiters, HR team members and engineering managers directly on Linkedin. It makes you stand out and adds a human touch to your job application.

Even if you don't get a job you may get some advice. People love to help! 

## Tailor your CV
Don't fire the same CV to every business. Make it suit the job on offer and the company. 

## Reach out to your networks
Finally, scream and shout about your intended career change. People will help you and you may be suprised by the number of trainee schemes that your friends and networks may be aware of.
