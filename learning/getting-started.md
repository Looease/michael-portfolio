Getting started is the first and most important part of becoming a Software Engineer. Spending time writing coding is the best way to learn but it's not always easy to know where to start. 

The following resources are for beginners learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. There are many other development launguages out there.


## Resources to get started coding

## Technology
You can't go too far wrong with a computer with a Mac, Windows or Linux operating system. This is because when you are coding, you will need to create files for your code which you will need to save to your harddrive. I made a mistake in buying a Google Chromebook when I first started which did not work it's mainly for browsing the internet and doesn't let you save files.  

Once you've got your laptop you will need to download a code editor or IDE to write your code on. The most popular one I have come across in the workplace is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>. <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> is another popular one. If you do find yourself with a Chromebook, you can use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/">Caret</a>

## Online Training 
 I began learning to code with <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a> on <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy</a>. The Web Developer Bootcamp is designed for begineers and has tens of thousands of reviews of happy customers who'd learnt the basics of web development. Udemy does amazing discounts on courses and this one cost only £14.99 (top tip is never pay more than £20 for a course on Udemy). 
 
The course is very thorough and I got a lot of value from it, particularly in learning CSS. It is quite long (60+ hours)and a lot of motivation is needed to get through it. Truth be told I have still not completed all of the modules and this is something I am looking to finish this year. 

It's definitely worth the investment and I see a lot of junior software engineers reference it as their sole training tool when changing career into software engineering.

## Training websites and blogs 

There are so many blogs, websites and training resources online for learning to code. Some of my favourites were:

- <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3 Schools</a> - this is a controversial one and senior developers will tell you it's out of date. However, when getting to learn the very basics I think it's amazing. It's simple and has loads of examples and snippets of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C# code and more.  
- <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">get in touch</a>Flexbox Froggy - a game which actually makes learning Flexbox fun. There are a lot of games out there to help learn to code which I found useful.
- <a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/"></a> Learn Git Branching - Github is a unique skill to learn in itself. It is used to host website and also lets developers share their code in a clean way. No matter what coding language you learn, you will most likely find yourself using Github. This game - Learn Git Branching - simplifies learning Github commands and how it works in general
