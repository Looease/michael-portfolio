So are coding bootcamps worth it?

In short, yes. 

I believe coding bootcamps are essential to make a career change into software engineering if you have been working for few years. If you are at the very beginning of your career, this may not apply. The reason the bootcamp is important is because you will be competing against people with degrees in Computer Science (or similar) and if you do not have any prior coding experience you will be disadvantaged. This information should not dishearten you in any way! A degree in Computer Science is extremely vast and graduates can and do get into a whole host of roles. Coding bootcamps are specifically aimed at getting you ready to become a web-developer in an enterprise environment so - if anything  - this specialist focus can be an advantage. 

There are of bootcamps out there that suit all timelines and budgets - it's up to you what you want to get from it. 

Courses are run by <a>Makers Academy</a>, <a>General Assembly</a>, <a>Founders and Coders</a> and <a>Code First Girls</a>, to name a few. 

I chose <a>23 Code Street</a> as I liked their mission to level the gender playing field in tech and, it was only two evenings a week.

-  We did small HTML and CSS projects initially. I appreciated the support and ability to discuss code. 
-  We had a slack chanel for support outside of lesson time. 
-  A great resource I got here was Flexbox Froggy - a game which actually makes learning Flexbox fun. There are a lot of games out there to help learn to code which I found useful.
-  We were taught by software engineers and did daily projects using what we had learned.
-  It was definitely necesseray to practice outside of the lesson time to keep up. The course I did with Udemy was really useful and another fantastic source is Youtube. There are thousands of tutorials and ideas on there.
-  We then moved onto Javascript using the HTML Canvas and created functions to create random patterns through to a basic version of Flappy Bird.
-  Finally we built our group project -  Museum Meltdown -  in HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
-  Here I learnt about Github, a hosting website for code that lets you share code across different computers. There is a lot more to Github but ultimately, you can host small projects for free on here. If you have any specific questions about 23 Code Street please get in touch.

To be honest, the bootcamp was very basic and a substantial amount of personal learning was required. The best part about the bootcamp was the final group project I made that gave me something to put on my CV and talk about in detail in job interviews.
