<p class="blurb">My name is Michael Gilligan and am currently a freelance design engineer, beneath is the
work that I created on the solidworks program and in the workshop using 3D printing
machines available program throughout my time at university, due to covid restrictions
during my time at university many of these designs have only been created through CAD,
but I have experience in a workshop environment from my time at college. My skillsets
include a wide variety of Solidworks and Autodesk programs, I am very well equipped to use
the Microsoft packages such as word, PowerPoint and excel, please feel free to look through
my work that I have created at university on this portfolio of such work.
All work has been created with association of Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU)
be that lecturer or any staff or student member who was willing to give advice for the
completion of the work.
