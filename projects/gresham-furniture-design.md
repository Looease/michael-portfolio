For this project we were to assume the role of a freelance design engineer and have been informed that the new science block for Manchester metropolitan university (mmu) will have an open space where the students can relax during time between lectures or for just a study space that offers alternatives to the library and similar study spaces. This area will require functional seating that will suit the building and will also offer use for independent study or can have a feel of connection to other members of the university making it a joint study space. Gresham Office Furniture are creating the furniture and want to see what is on offer and potentially take the designs into the open space.

The chair solution itself was told that it would need to suit an individual studier but also a group study session, the design I had was made from 100% recycled materials and gave the user the option to lift up panels or have them lowered if the user wanted to work with others, the bottom has an area where power cords could be run through and the user can store items


The above hiking generator works by placing it in a bag or around the waist of the user and then the 2 clips are placed on the shoes heels so that when the feet move they pull on the strings that they are attached too which then powers the device so that the user can then charge items such as a mobile device or anything portable that they may have too hand.
