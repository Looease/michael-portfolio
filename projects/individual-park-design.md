During this project we were split in teams of 3 or 4 members to create an electrical park. the premise was that the park would be able to be controlled through an app downloaded on the phone and it would be able to connect remotely to the objects built for the park. the group aspect was so that in the end we could piece all of parts together and create one big park, this meant that before going into the creation a theme of the park would be chosen so we were not making parts that would not match together, the theme of our park was that it would be jungle themed so the main colours of the par would be green, brown and tan, this decision was made as most parks are found in green areas and we thought as a team this would blend in well with the natural surroundings whilst also being enjoyable for the users of the park.

The design that I created for the electric park was a climbing frame as seen in the photos above. the premise of this was it would work as a normal climbing frame for people who say could not get the app to control it on the phone for whatever reason that may be. the user would climb the steps into the first tower and then be faced with 5 stepping stones and 4 pieces of rope, without the app the user could swing or jump to each stepping stone, but the feature that I suggested for the piece would make it so the app could change the distance of the stepping stones or remove some entirely to make it more challenging say if the user had done this before or felt they could handle the challenge. This product used 11 different parts with some being used more than once to create the final assembly. As seen in the poster it shows that the other 2 members of the team created a slide and roundabout that also had features to do with the app.
