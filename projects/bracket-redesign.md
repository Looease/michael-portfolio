This was my individual engineering project that I undertook in the 2nd half of my final year. the title we were given for this was that it had to fall in the category of 'engineering materials & manufacturing'. After some deliberation I concluded that I would change the materials of an existing product and test the original product and the new products and see if the new products could perform the same and try and find a way to save money and a potentially more environmentally friendly way of producing the product.

The investigation discovered that the original bracket (Left) could be produced on a 3D printing machine made from a variety of different plastics. the plastic production meant that it was cheaper to produce and cold be produced in batch's using less power and therefore more environmentally friendly. The tests that the new and original products went through was a strength test, this was done by simulating the weight of a hanging flower basket and hanging it off a wall and leaving it suspended over the floor for the same time. All the products were able to make it through this test without buckling or any change to the product during the test. The thermal test included heating the products to 100 degrees and seeing if any deformation was caused to the product or if it felt any weaker and the products could all be used in the same manner.
