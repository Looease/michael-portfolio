The purpose of this project was to evaluate a face shield design with one or more mechanical mechanism. Research was done into trends to with the face shield, such as existing products and current trends. This was time relevant as this was during the pandemic and it was not known at that point how long we would have to live with masks in the everyday use so new solutions were looked at so that if the face masks were continued to be used then new solutions suited to everyone's needs would be available.

This design proved to me that not everything in the design process is always as straight forward as the designer tends to believe. the concept drawing shows an almost glasses experience on the face shield but the final render has a headband, this became apparent that the headband was needed as this could be adjusted to fit all head sizes and would hold onto the head better making the experience for the user and the person on the other end better. With the design itself, it shows that it can be extended the full way p or at the halfway point so that the user can still eat and the eyes and nose will still be protected.
