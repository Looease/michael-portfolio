During the pandemic university was shut down and towards the end of our 1st year we were due to measure up a product that could be found in the workshop and then recreate this product on a 1:1 scale on solidworks. Due to the pandemic this was not possible and the brief was altered slightly so that it would then be a product that is either something in our home or something that we may use on a daily basis.s

This bottle above is a Nike water bottle that I used to use on a daily basis to drink from and use in activities such as going to the gym and running and the product lasted well and was durable so I thought creating this would be a good idea, I measured it all up and then created the main body piece and the lid and then connected them together in an assembly on a 1:1 scale. I also added an image on a Nike tick to make the product feel as authentic as the original product.
