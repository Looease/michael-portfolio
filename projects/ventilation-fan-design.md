The premise for this assignment to assume we are a freelance design engineer and a engineering firm in the city of Manchester is designing a new engineering building, in this building they want to have a ventilation system that uses fresh air from the outside while also expelling air out of the building. The starting point is to look at the secondary research and look  into existing designs that use this process already, furthermore research will be done into the materials used for each component that creates the fan, the manufacturing, and the mechanical properties of the product. The brief also set 6 main requirements that the product should stick too.

</div>


The vent fan was created by looking at existing designs that are similar and working out the mechanism would work to get in the fresh air whilst also releasing the air. This used 12 different parts with some being used more than once. a buckle test was also done on the shaft to simulate if the newly designed shaft would be able to hold the components. the test showed that the closer the parts are placed to the centre point the less chance it will have of buckling and this would be done if the product was made.
