The company came to the university with a proposal on a product they had and changes that could potentially be made to the product. The product itself was a handheld vacuum that is used to pick up rubbish from the floor in areas that a normal vacuum may not be able to reach such as a car or on a work site, but could also be used in household as a normal vacuum could be.

The newly designed vacuum stayed true to the original design and shape as seen above, the model was recreated in solidworks on a 1:1 scale including all the parts that would assemble and the charging port used as a stand to show off the product. It was recommended that at least 3 changes were to be made for the product. The changes that I made to the product was that I changed the existing battery from a 7.2 volt battery to a 9v volt battery, this was done so that the power output would be greater and a longer life cycle of the product. The second and third changes included changing the power button from a push and hold to work to a flip switch and the grip had a rubber grove added to make it more comfortable, these two changes help the ergonomics and anthropometrics of the product as the flip switch would make it easier for the product as they would not have to hold it to make it work and the grip makes it comfier to use.
