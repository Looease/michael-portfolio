Getting started is the most important part of becoming a Software Engineer. You can spend time on theory but starting coding is the best way to learn. 

The following resources are for beginners learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. There are many other development launguages out there.


## Resources for getting started coding

 - I began learning to code with The Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy. The course cost Â£14.99 and was designed for beginners. You can go back and forward in the course at your own pace. 
 - You need to download a text editor to write your code in. I was using a Chromebook at this stage so used Caret. If you are using Windows or Mac, you have more choices. A popular one is Visual Studio Code.
- An essential resource is W3 Schools. They have break downs of HTML CSS and Javascript. Once you've got to grips with HTML, you move on to CSS which lets you add style to code. Without CSS, all websites would look like the above.It starts off very basic and there are simple code alongs to get you used to it.
- Then you start building things that look like real websites. We started using Flexbox which is the latest way to style and layout elements.
- For me, Flexbox was where things became more complex. Whilst HTML is very similar to spoken English, Flexbox is computer language. I found this resource - CSS Tricks- so useful for both Flexbox and CSS.
- Images are styled with CSS whether they are backgrounds, photo grids or products. A great free image resource is Unsplash. Photographers upload amazing free stock photos you can use on your websites. I have also used images from Shuttershock and Canva on this site.
- I came across a big obstable when I started learning Javascript. Computer files are essential for writing code but I did not know how to create files with Caret or the Chromebook. I felt a bit stuck and lost motivation and so - in the interest of full transparency - put my learning on hold.
- I decided to invest in a Macbook Air and a coding course to get the support I needed. 
- I'd like to make a small point on tech. You don't need the most modern or expensive laptop but you do definintely need one with a Mac, Windows or Linux operating system.
