There are of coding bootcamps out there that suit all timelines and budgets.

## Coding Bootcamps

-  Courses are run by Makers Academy, General Assembly, Founders and Coders and Code First Girls, to name a few. I chose 23 Code Street as I liked their mission to level the gender playing field in tech, and the fact that it was only two evenings a week.
-  We did small HTML and CSS projects initially. I appreciated the support and ability to discuss code. We had a slack chanel for support outside of lesson time. A great resource I got here was Flexbox Froggy - a game which actually makes learning Flexbox fun. There are a lot of games out there to help learn to code which I found useful.
-  We were taught by software engineers and did daily projects using what we had learned.
-  It was definitely necesseray to practice outside of the lesson time to keep up. The course I did with Udemy was really useful and another fantastic source is Youtube. There are thousands of tutorials and ideas on there.
-  We then moved onto Javascript (at last). Javascript adds funtionality to websites from changing thumbnail images on products to updating shopping baskets. We started using the HTML Canvas and created functions to create random patterns through to a basic version of Flappy Bird.
-  Finally we built our group project, Museum Meltdown, in HTML, CSS and Javascript. Here I learnt about Github, a hosting website for code that lets you share code across different computers. There is a lot more to Github but ultimately, you can host small projects for free on here. If you have any specific questions about 23 Code Street please get in touch.
